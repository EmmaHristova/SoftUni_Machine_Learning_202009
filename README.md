SoftUni is one of the largest and most respected educational institutions, providing training and career support in the fields of software engineering, digital marketing and design. Founded in 2013, SoftUni is rapidly becoming a market leader and today organizes a number of training programs, free courses and seminars, events and other educational initiatives that provide quality education to thousands of young people in Bulgaria in the IT and Digital technologies. SoftUni works directly with over 200 technology companies and has an active community of hundreds and thousands of people.

Machine learning is the intersection of programming with mathematical and scientific methods. It is the science of how to get computers to make decisions without being specifically programmed beforehand. Thanks to it, we live in a world that seems to have come out of science fiction: a website recognizes people's emotions, machine translation is getting better, self-driving cars are being developed, we are offered advertisements based on our own desires and needs.

From the little script that warns that a hard drive is about to burn, to the algorithms that are changing the world, machine learning is gaining in popularity and giving better and better results.

In this course we will get acquainted with the basics, thanks to which all machine learning algorithms work. We will look at the main types of problems to which we can reduce any real problem (such as regression and classification). For each task we will get acquainted with several algorithms that solve it, and for each algorithm we will understand when it is used, how it is trained and tested.

During the course we will solve a number of practical tasks using the Python language - one of the most popular languages for science and data.

The training, by itself, or in combination with knowledge of mathematics and data science, is a starting point for career development: for positions such as Machine Learning Engineer, Applied Machine Learning Researcher, Data Scientist, or similar.
